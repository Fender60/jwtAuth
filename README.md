# Reminder - Reminder website solution

This web service helps users not to forget about important tasks, appointments and daily activities. With its help, you can create lists of reminders, specifying the date and time when they should go off. At the appointed moment, the user will receive a notification in Telegram messenger, which is especially convenient, as many people actively use messengers and will not miss an important message.
